				BoilerSwap was born from a simple observation: every semester, especially during move-out
				periods, tons of perfectly good items end up in dumpsters around campus. Meanwhile, other
				students are spending money on the same items at stores.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-4">
				Created by Purdue students for Purdue students, BoilerSwap bridges this gap by providing a
				platform where students can easily give away items they no longer need and find items they
				do need - all for free.
			</p>
			<p>
				What started as a solution to reduce waste has grown into a community-building platform that
				embodies the Boilermaker spirit of helping one another and making a positive impact.
